#### STEEMBLR GOALS AND VALUES
Steemblr is an open-source micro-blogging media app based on the steem blockchain. Steemblr has no direct reward pattern, but uses Steemit as a front-end for the steem users on the platform. 

## GOALS

Steemblr supports both steem and non-steem users registration and activities on the platform. It aims at creating an ecosystem where both steem and non-steem users can co-habit in a social environment. It focuses on creating a decentralized and uncensored platform where users can blog about almost anything including quotes.   

Steemblr also aims at creating an environment where non-steem users will get attracted to the steem blockchain which will directly lead to the onboard of new users on the steem blockchain.
